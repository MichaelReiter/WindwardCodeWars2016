Start with 6 tiles
Start with $6000
Buy up to 3 shares of stock per turn (doesn't include what you already gained that turn)
Must place a tile on the board every turn
If a tile shares a spot on the board with a tile that doesn't have a corporation, a corporation is founded.
If tile is adjacent to an existing corporation, it grows the corporation.

When a smaller company is bought out in a merger, the player with the most shares gets the majority stakeholder bonus, the player with the second most gets the minority shareholder bonus. All other players get to sell their at their current value, trade them in 2 for 1 for the larger company, or keep them for later. This is the only way to make money.
